### Still to do:

In no particular order:

- Start doing Test Driven Development
- Add the Isle of Man to Liverpool Diocese
- Add the Channel islands to Portsmouth Diocese
- Make the diocese borders more accurate so users can zoom in even further
- Label the Dioceses
- Add an info box
- Colour code by ecclesiastical province
- Start adding statistics and the ability to rank by statistics (e.g. population, number of baptisms, annual spending)
- Tidy up copyright notice
- Make a gif/timeline of how the diocese boundaries have changed over time
- Add in Cathedrals
- Add in Scottish and Irish dioceses
- (Stretch goal) Add in Anglican Dioceses + other religious regions
